### changes has been done for testing only

Steps: 
we can build the ec2 instance using terraform and 
install anythig needed on that instance (in this case a jenkins server)

This can be done from either a Win 10 machine using Git-bash 
or from any linux machine example ubuntu on AWS or a local VM.

Pre-req is Terraform must be installed on that machine 
and to execute terraform from anywhere its binaries must be in path folder.


create all .tf files needed as shown below
(on win see files ex: C:\001-G7-2021\projects\terraform\aws-jenkins)

On linux, go to the folder where you created the files on Linux:
ex:aws-jenkins: 
ls -la
vim securitygroups.tf
ls -la

terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform plan
terraform validate
terraform apply

At this point terraform would have created a new instance using the above configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

after logging in to the new instance from another bash-terminal:

    sudo su - 
    cd /var/log
    ls -lrt
    tail -f user-data.log
this verified the action happened due to user-data

to verify the software installed ex: webserver nginx, or apache or jenkins
from your host go to the public ip address of the new machine and check the server installed.
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Ex: Jenkins: http://ip-address:8080
